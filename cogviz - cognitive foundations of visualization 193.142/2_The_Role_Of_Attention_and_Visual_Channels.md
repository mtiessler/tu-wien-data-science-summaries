# Role of Attention and Visual Channels

Visual perception is **heavily influenced by attention** — meaning, what we focus on determines what information we retain and process. Although the eyes receive a vast amount of visual input, **only a small portion is stored**, and **what is stored depends on the task at hand**.

> 📌 **Key Point**: Visualization design must account for the limits of attention. A visualization that distracts or misleads the viewer is ineffective — it must be structured to support attention, not compete with it.

---

## Inattentional Blindness

**Inattentional blindness** refers to the failure to notice significant changes in a scene when our attention is focused elsewhere. This phenomenon underscores how **attention shapes perception**.

> 🎥 **Example**: The famous Daniel Simons experiment ([Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrrVozZR2c)) shows that people often **fail to notice when one person is replaced by another** after a brief interruption.

### ✏️ Practical Implications:
- Drivers may **fail to notice pedestrians or cyclists** despite looking in their direction.
- **Eyewitness testimonies** can be unreliable due to inattentional blindness.

> 🧠 “Vision is not about creating a perfect internal model of the world, but about **efficiently extracting meaning** from what we see.”

---

## The World as Its Own Memory

We do **not memorize every detail** of the world. Instead, we treat the environment as an **external memory**, accessing details **only when needed**.

> 🔍 **Design Implication**:  
Effective visualizations should **make relevant information easy to access** — not overwhelm the user with excessive detail.

---

## Guiding Attention in Visualization

Since attention is **selective**, visualizations should be **strategically designed to guide it** toward the most important elements.

### ✅ Principles for Managing Attention:
1. **Identify the primary goal** of the visualization  
2. **Structure visual elements** to support that goal  
3. **Minimize distractions** that may mislead or confuse the user

> 🎯 **Goal**: Help users find what matters most — quickly and accurately.

---

## Visual Queries & Task-Oriented Design

**Visual queries** are the **eye movements and attention shifts** users perform to extract information from a visualization.

> 📌 The effectiveness of a visualization depends on **how well it supports the user's visual queries**.

### 🔍 Example – Reading a Map:
To find a route, a user must:
1. Identify the **starting point**  
2. Identify the **destination**  
3. **Trace the connection** between them  
4. Observe **changes or obstacles** along the path

---

## Cognitive Principles for Effective Visualization

These key principles should inform every visualization design:

1. **Selective Attention** – Users focus only on parts relevant to their task  
2. **Inattentional Blindness** – Important info might be missed if attention is not guided  
3. **The World as External Memory** – Don't overload users with details they don't need immediately  
4. **Visual Queries** – Design should support natural scanning and info retrieval

> 🧩 **Bottom Line**:  
Effective visualizations are not just beautiful — they are **task-driven tools**.

---

## Role of the Designer

To build attention-friendly visualizations, designers should:

1. **Define the user's objective**  
2. **Identify the visual queries** required to achieve that objective  
3. **Optimize layout and visual elements** to support these queries and minimize cognitive effort

## What Can We Easily See?

Some visualization features are easier to detect than others, due to the way our visual system processes information. This impacts how visualizations should be designed.

> 🔍 **Example**:  
A list of numbers without color requires a **linear, slow search**. But if one number is colored red while the others are grey, it can be detected **immediately** — thanks to **preattentive processing**.

---

## Why Are Some Visualizations Easier to Use?

Certain features enable **quick, parallel search**:

- **Plain Numbers in a List**: Require slow, sequential processing.
- **Color-Coded Values**: Enable fast, preattentive detection.
  
> **Takeaway**: The way data is encoded visually can **dramatically affect** how quickly and accurately it is understood.

---

## The Role of V1 & V2 in Visual Processing

Visual information is processed early on in the **V1 and V2 regions of the brain**. Neurons in these regions are sensitive to:

- **Form**  
- **Color**  
- **Motion**  
- **Orientation**  
- **Depth**

When a visual element matches a **target feature we’re searching for**, neurons in these areas **fire more rapidly** — enabling **parallel processing** across different parts of the image.

> 🧠 Our brains don’t scan visualizations sequentially — they detect relevant features in **parallel** using tuned neural pathways.

---

## Preattentive Features

Some visual characteristics are processed **automatically and unconsciously**, before focused attention is applied. These are known as **preattentive features**.

### Common Preattentive Features:
- **Color**
- **Shape**
- **Size**
- **Orientation**
- **Position**
- **Contrast**
- **Motion**

> Use preattentive features to **draw attention** and help users find key elements **instantly**.

## Guidelines for Effective Visualization Design

1. **"Eyes Beat Memory"**  
   Design visualizations so that users can **see** rather than **recall** — avoid forcing users to memorize data or switch views repeatedly.

2. **Make Tasks and Queries Explicit**  
   Always define the **questions** the visualization is meant to answer, and **map those to visual queries**.

3. **Leverage Preattentive Features**  
   Use visual features like **color, size, and position** to highlight important data points and streamline interpretation.

## Visual Channels: Mapping Data to Graphics

A **visual channel** is a graphical property (like color, position, or size) used to **represent data**.

> “Every visualization is a wrapping of data properties in visual properties.”

Not all channels are equally good at conveying information. Two key properties define their use:

---

### 1. **Expressiveness**
- **What can this channel represent?**
- Channels vary in their ability to convey different **statistical types** of data.

---

### 2. **Effectiveness**
- **How well can the viewer interpret the channel?**
- Some channels allow faster or more accurate interpretation.

## Channel Effectiveness by Statistical Type

| Statistical Type | Data Class (Qualitative/Quantitative) | Suitable Visual Channels                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Nominal**      | Categorical (Qualitative)              | Color Hue, Shape, Spatial Region         |
| **Ordinal**      | Categorical with Order                 | Color Intensity, Size, Position (1D)     |
| **Interval**     | Quantitative                           | Position (1D), Length, Angle             |
| **Ratio**        | Quantitative (Zero has meaning)        | Position (2D), Length, Area, Volume      |
| **Temporal**     | Quantitative (Time-ordered)            | Position (X-axis), Line Connection, Motion |

> Use the **most expressive and effective channel** available for your data type. For instance, **position** is typically more precise than **color** for quantitative data.
