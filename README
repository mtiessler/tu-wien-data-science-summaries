i'll gladly remove content or give proper credit when due, as a courtesy. legally, i own the plain text (except for some snippets from the vorlesungs wiki).

this repository caused a lot of controversy. at the lecturers' and dean's request some parts were removed, due to misuse and plagiarism in assignments. students copied entire submissions, including my name and matriculation number.

the controversy came at a cost. most lecturers threatened legal action and penalized me with massive points deductions.

but i gained a lot, too. other lecturers complimented and encouraged my efforts to provide extra teaching materials. i also made a lot of new friends and gained a deeper understanding of the material.

so in the end, this project built more bridges than it burned. thank you! <3
